READme Fix_five_prime_CDS
=========================

### `tests`

This is a real example of sequences which needed "correcting"

To run the tests, alter the file and type:

``
./prepare_data_run_test
``

you will have to change the directory in the script. 

The file:

### `EXAMPLE_depth_per_base_incorrect_prediction.tmp`

Contains reads per base expression, which when plotted the true ATG can be seen, however, this is not predicted coreectly. 


The file:

### `INFO_for_those_that_need_to_be_fixed.out`

contains the sequences needing to be fixed and their expected true cds.
